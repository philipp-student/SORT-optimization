# Seminararbeit - Fahrassistenzsysteme 2

This project was implemented as part of the module "Driver Assistance Systems 2" in the Computer Science master's course at the Ruhr West University for Applied Sciences.

The subject of this project is the implementation and evaluation of an adapted variant of the MOT framework [SORT](https://github.com/abewley/sort). The variant presented here differs from the original with regard to the association metric and the used detector.
